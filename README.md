General purpose map voting plugin.

</div>

# Features
- Reads from a custom maplist
- RTV Command (Using !rtv in chat, or with Panorama system that is built into CS2 [F1 = Yes, F2 = No])
- End of Map Vote. Supports map cooldown, map extension option.
- Map cooldown persistence. Recently played maps stay on cooldown across server restarts (stored in mapcooldown.txt).
- !revote command. During an active End of Map Vote, lets a player reopen the menu to change their vote. Uses a frozen WASD menu with no exit, so they must make a selection. Re-typing !revote while the menu is open does nothing (vote already active). Toggled via EndOfMapVote.EnableRevote.
- Nominate command (nominate a map to appear in the map vote). Partial name matching, and conflicting map name resolution (surf_beginner, surf_beginner2). Limit 1 per player.

  ![nominate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac056bc-9842-4422-ac0d-c7cd814b3ba6)
  
- Supports workshop maps, and custom map names. E.g. "surf_beginner (T1, Staged)"
- Nextmap command. Prints the next map to chat.
- Translated (Google Translate, ymmv)
- Extend command. !extend 10 extends map by 10 minutes (flag restricted)
- Vote Extend command. !ve/!votextend starts a vote to extend the current map (flag restricted)
- Map Chooser command. !mapmenu opens a menu with your map list, selected map is changed to immediately (flag restricted)
- Optional sound alert when map vote or !rtv starts (configurable sound)
- Optional hud alert
  
  ![hudalert](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c35f20-b4f0-4122-b241-287b44efdb27)

 ![chatcountdown](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/803826a1-665b-4ab7-9e38-fbb0e8d702be)

![panoramavote](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ebe223-225f-4cef-812e-3bf6c56e590d)
![voteextend](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cfd9a5f-36a5-4a11-ae26-3e74d5387251)
- ChatMenu/CenterHtmlMenu/WasdMenu/ConsoleMenu for EndOfMapVote/!nominate/!votemap

![wasdmenu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1df185bf-4313-4010-81de-98111ae383dc)
![chatmenu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d7e9ee8-b26e-47b1-89d8-ced96b13a392)
![hudmenu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fd37e45-bf7f-4f97-9b7b-7fab92352392)

- Maplist Validator. Send to error log or Discord when a map is no longer available on the workshop. Automatically removes invalid workshop maps from the in-memory map list so they can't be nominated, voted for, or switched to (maplist.txt is left untouched). Optionally set a Steam Web API key to batch validation (100 IDs per request) instead of 1 request/second HTML checks.

  ![WorkshopMapLog](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f65dd9d-1ee9-4217-a753-81358973df2e)
- !maps command. List all maps available in the console.
  
![mapscommand](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ab1377-0b29-45b6-bdaa-06b6a7664751)

- !cooldown command. List the maps currently on cooldown in the console (most recently played at the top). Configurable aliases, 10 second per-player cooldown.
- !reloadmaps command. Rebuild the map list mid game
- !reloadrtv command. Reload the rtv config mid game
